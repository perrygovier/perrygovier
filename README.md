 ### Hello, I'm Perry

I'm a faculty instructor at [Madison College](https://madisoncollege.edu) in [Madison, WI](https://www.instagram.com/cityofmadison/?hl=en) where I focus on teaching front-end development. 

Previously, I worked with [Ionic](https://ionic.io) for seven years in Madison and [Teal Media](https://tealmedia.com) most recently. Before that, I got my professional start at Minneapolis-based agencies like [Spyder Trap](https://www.linkedin.com/company/spydertrap/about/) and [Reliable Sites](https://www.linkedin.com/company/reliable-sites/), both of which have since been [aquired](https://tcbmag.com/bright-health-acquires-marketing-agency-spyder-trap/). I graduated from Metropolitan State University in 2010, and have been working in the web and app development space since 2008. 

The wonderful thing about Perry Govier's, is that I'm the only one!* So if you see a “Perry Govier” online, stop by to say “Hello."
<sub>*There is one other Perry Govier that I’m aware of, but he’s a retired Canadian firefighter who isn’t online except for a mostly abandoned Facebook account.</sub>

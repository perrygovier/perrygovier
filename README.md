### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a faculty instructor at [Madison College](https://madisoncollege.edu) in [Madison, WI](https://www.instagram.com/cityofmadison/?hl=en) where I focus on teaching front end development. 

Previously, I worked with [Ionic](https://ionic.io) for 7 years in Madison and [Teal Media](https://tealmedia.com) most recently. Before that, I got my professional start at Minneapolis-based agencies like [Spyder Trap](https://www.linkedin.com/company/spydertrap/about/) and [Reliable Sites](https://www.linkedin.com/company/reliable-sites/), both of which have since been [aquired](https://tcbmag.com/bright-health-acquires-marketing-agency-spyder-trap/). I graduated from Metropolitan State University in 2010, and have been working in the web and app development space since 2008. 

There's only one other Perry Govier that I'm aware of and he's a retiree who doesn't have a big online presence, so if you see a "Perry Govier" online, it's probably me.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a faculty instructor at Madison College in Madison, WI where I focus on teaching front end development. 

Previously, I worked with @ionic-team for 7 years in Madison and @tealmedia. Before that, I got my professional start at Minneapolis-based agencies like Spyder Trap and Reliable sites, both of which have since been aquired. I graduated from Metropolitan State University in 2010, and have been working in the web and app development space since 2008. 

There's only one other Perry Govier that I'm aware of and he's a retiree who doesn't have a big online presence, so if you see a "Perry Govier" online, it's probably me.
